QC: Removed 0% of sites with coverage lower than 3.
Parallel: Parallelizing using 38 workers/cores (backend: BiocParallel:MulticoreParam).
Step 1: Detecting candidate regions with (smoothed) variance larger than 0.1...
...Chromosome pseudo: Smoothed (0.18 min). 
...Finished calling candidate regions - found 10730 candidate regions in total.
  ...8.4% QC-passed sites are called to be in candidate regions.
WARNING:
  Consider lowering 'cutoff' since only 8.4% QC-passed sites are called to be in candidate region.
    ...If not, might induce low statistical power.
Step 2: Detecting VMRs without penalty...
...Finished detecting VMRs - took 142.98 min and 2029 VMRs found in total.
  ...1.35% QC-passed sites are called to be in VMRs.
